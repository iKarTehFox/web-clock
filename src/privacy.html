                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Welcome to Online Web Clock (the "Website"). This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled when you use the Website. By accessing or using the Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>I, Diego P. (iKarTehFox), do not collect any data whatsoever from visitors of the Website. Your privacy is important, and no personal information or usage data is gathered, stored, or shared by me.</p>

                <h3>Weather Widget</h3>
                <p>The Website includes a feature that allows you to use the OpenWeatherMap widget to obtain the current weather for your location or any location you set. Please note the following:</p>

                <p><b>GPS:</b> If you choose to use the GPS feature, your device's geolocation data will be used to determine your location. This geolocation data is not sent to or stored by me. Instead, it is used solely with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.</p>

                <p><b>OpenWeatherMap API:</b> The use of your location data is governed by the privacy policy and terms of OpenWeatherMap. For more information on how they handle your data, please review their <a href="https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, including their <a href="https://openweather.co.uk/storage/app/media/Terms/Openweather_website_terms_and_conditions_of_use.pdf">Terms</a>.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If I make any changes, I'll struggle trying to figure out how to notify you. I encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates or changes.</p>
